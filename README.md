# Welcome

This github repo replaces the meetup London group which was not good value for money at $280 / year.


# Notifications

To be notified of new events watch this repo (top right):

If you no longer want to be notified you can "unwatch" (same menu).

This repo is for event coordination **only** to minimize spam for subscribers. For other discussion please [check the community page where people hang out](https://nixos.org/community.html).


# Events

For events we will file a new issue where people can comment to signal attendance.

Sometimes real names are required for building security - we can collect those via email as-needed.
